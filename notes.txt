awards-ceremony:
    might want to only use the first 50
    but actually it generally sucks

car-accident:
    don't yet have a classifier for wreckage (perhaps not the best 'event' to look for)

birthday-party:
    missing cake?

play:
    there are too many things in the play...(maybe ignore?)

luncheon:
    seems to be a lot of websites later becuase started taking pictures of menus
    and invitations

party: has too much stuff (stage, comic book, theater curtain, dust cover, whistle)
seminar has similar problem to party

snowboarding mistaken for skiing
