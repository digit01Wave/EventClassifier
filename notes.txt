awards-ceremony:
    might want to only use the first 50
    but actually it generally sucks

car-accident:
    don't yet have a classifier for wreckage (perhaps not the best 'event' to look for)

birthday-party:
    missing cake?

play:
    there are too many things in the play...(maybe ignore?)

luncheon:
    seems to be a lot of websites later becuase started taking pictures of menus
    and invitations

party: has too much stuff (stage, comic book, theater curtain, dust cover, whistle)
seminar has similar problem to party

snowboarding mistaken for skiing

bocce kinda sucks too: got croquet ball a lot

hiking kinda sucks

concert very good but the stage keeps taking up more stuff than it
    maybe lower the relative stuff

Chirstmas looks pretty random though seems to do a bit better when include all the items

St. patricks day also pretty useless

exhibition -wait - thinks it is a picture place/movie house...

after b1750 we did proper tag adding
