THINGS TO DO:
-delete methods:
    main_event_classifier:
        salient_to_csv
        return_normal
    file_dictionary
        super_combo

Difficult to Classify:
    -graduation 1532, impossible to classify but whatever...
    -children bday 1968
    -graduation 1537 is kinda hard as well unless you could read what they are holding
    -wedding 873 just full of people and maybe one in a white dress, but it's just a dress...
    -cruise6796 - very hard because took pics of scenery
    -cruise6799- misclassified - ignore
    -grad1584 difficult because no gowns
Skipped (unable for even a human to determine):
    -children bday 1966
    -wedding946





Notes about dict_files:
-awards-ceremony:
    might want to only use the first 50
    but actually it generally sucks

-car-accident:
    don't yet have a classifier for wreckage (perhaps not the best 'event' to look for)

-luncheon:
    seems to be a lot of websites later becuase started taking pictures of menus
    and invitations

-party: has too much stuff (stage, comic book, theater curtain, dust cover, whistle)
-seminar has similar problem to party

-snowboarding mistaken for skiing (do not use together because no concept for snowboard)

bocce kinda sucks too: got croquet ball a lot

hiking kinda sucks so will just stick it with rock climbing for now

Seminar maybe not the best becuase has a lot of cinema and stage... (can be mistaken with movies but ok)

concert very good but the stage keeps taking up more stuff than it
    maybe lower the relative stuff --> update, did them both and both not bad...

Chirstmas looks pretty random though seems to do a bit better when include all the items

St. patricks day also pretty useless

exhibition -wait - thinks it is a picture place/movie house...

after b1750 we did proper tag adding

Things we have yet to include/modify
-bday with birthday-party (DONE) //actually no. it seems like bday is closter to kids
-chirstmas
-probably need to delete concert 50
-maybe combine concert and concertAll?
-easter is a biiiit iffy (ok, very iffy. Keeps seeing egg as a croquet ball)
-perhaps just keep pary
